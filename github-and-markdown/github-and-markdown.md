# Github and Markdown

## Github

Github is an online platform where you can store, share and collaborate on remote git repositories. With GitHub, the same codebase can be shared and edited across many collaborators. Many repositories are open source, so you can view the code, create a copy, modify it or use it in your own projects.

## Markdown

The Markdown syntax allows writing formatted text (headlines, blockquotes, lists, etc.) that can be stored in plain text. It is used by tools and websites like GitHub or Slack. It uses specific characters to format parts of the text in a certain way.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Element   |            Markdown Syntax            |
| --------- | :-----------------------------------: |
| headlines | `#, ##, ### (level 1, 2, 3 headline)` |
| list item |             `- list item`             |
| link      |   `[link](https://www.example.com)`   |
| image     |        `![link](url to image)`        |
